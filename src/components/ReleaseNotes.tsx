    title: 'The Great Infrastructure Migration (IaC)',
    changes: [
      '**Migration to Terraform:** Transitioned all primary resource management to declarative Infrastructure as Code (HCL). The entire stack is now reproducible with a single `terraform apply` — eliminating manual console errors permanently.',
      '**CloudFront Distribution Orchestration:** Rewrote the full `aws_cloudfront_distribution` block in Terraform to systematically link the CDN with the EC2 origin, enforcing consistent edge-to-origin routing.',
      '**EC2 Identity Fix:** Resolved the "unnamed instance" problem by adding `tags` to `aws_instance` via Terraform, enabling precise CI/CD targeting by tag name instead of fragile instance IDs.',
      '**The Origin Link:** Wired the Elastic IP public DNS directly as the CloudFront origin through IaC, bypassing Route 53 Free Tier management issues entirely.',
      '**Resolved: 504 Gateway Timeout:** Fixed the CloudFront-to-EC2 pipeline blockage by setting `origin_protocol_policy` to `http-only` — the EC2 instance runs HTTP internally with TLS terminated at the edge.',
      '**Next.js RSC Cache Poisoning Fix:** Prevented CloudFront from serving raw RSC JSON payloads as HTML by creating a custom Terraform-managed cache policy that whitelists `rsc`, `next-router-prefetch`, and `Accept` headers as cache key parameters.',
      '**CNAME Conflict Resolution:** Cleaned up orphaned CNAME records left from manual console operations, allowing Terraform to assume full control of the `toey-sawatdee.me` domain mapping.',
      '**Zero-Footprint Secret Management:** Eliminated exposed GitHub tokens from CI/CD logs by migrating to AWS SSM Parameter Store (SecureString) with KMS encryption at rest.',
      '**IAM Least Privilege Implementation:** Authored a dedicated `ssm_parameter_read` policy in Terraform granting EC2 permission to self-retrieve the GHCR token (pull pattern) instead of receiving it externally (push pattern).',
      '**GitHub Actions Shell Overhaul:** Fixed syntax errors in `aws ssm send-command` caused by incorrect backslash escaping. Enforced explicit `--region ap-southeast-2` on all SSM commands for deterministic execution.',
      '**Cleanup:** Purged hardcoded AWS Access Keys from `userdata.sh` and `deploy.yml` — a critical security vulnerability that exposed credentials in plaintext.',
      '**Value Proposition Design:** Introduced a new landing page section translating technical architecture into business outcomes (Security, Reliability, Performance, Cost) for non-technical stakeholders.',
      '**Infrastructure Pipeline Flow:** Redesigned the data flow visualization with static SVG connectors replacing the unstable `getBoundingClientRect` dynamic path calculation.',

      '**Edge Delivery Network:** Fronted the EC2 instance with AWS CloudFront CDN to cache static assets globally, drastically reducing origin server load and slashing latency to ~50ms.',
      '**Backdoor Origin Routing:** Engineered a custom DNS topology (`origin.toey-sawatdee.me`) to act as a secure backdoor for CloudFront, bypassing infinite routing loop traps.',
      '**Reverse Proxy Implementation:** Configured Nginx as the primary gatekeeper on the EC2 instance, securely intercepting port 80 traffic and proxying it to the internal Docker network.',
      '**Global HTTPS Encryption:** Enforced strict SSL/TLS encryption across the entire application by attaching an AWS ACM Certificate directly to the CloudFront edge network.',
      '**Origin Protection:** Eliminated direct public IP access to the application container; all public traffic must now pass through CloudFront and Nginx security layers.',
      '**Zero-Touch Deployment:** Engineered a fully automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, triggering build, publish, and deployment sequences on main branch merges.',
      '**Container Orchestration:** Integrated GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) and automated remote SSH commands to pull new images and restart containers.',
      '**Aggressive Image Optimization:** Implemented multi-stage Docker builds utilizing Next.js standalone mode, reducing final production image size to under 70MB.',
      '**Automated Cache Invalidation:** Integrated CloudFront cache invalidation (`/*`) directly into the deployment pipeline for real-time content updates.',
      '**Deprecations:** Sunset the legacy AWS S3 static site hosting architecture and removed raw EC2 public IP addresses from primary DNS A Records.'
